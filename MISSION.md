# MISSION.md — seithar-cogdef

**Status:** Operational  
**Purpose:** Detect and classify cognitive exploitation in content. Defensive instrumentation.

## Priorities

1. Scanner accuracy — reduce false positives, improve SCT mapping precision
2. Inoculator development — generate targeted cognitive defense training
3. Agent integration — keep SKILL.md current for OpenClaw ecosystem
4. DISARM framework alignment — maintain mapping to international standards

## Non-Goals

- This is not an offensive tool. Offensive profiling lives in HoleSpawn.
- No editorializing. Identify mechanism, report findings.
